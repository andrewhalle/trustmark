# TrustMark â€” Rust implementation

<div style={{display: 'none'}}>

An implementation in Rust of TrustMark watermarking, as described in [**TrustMark - Universal Watermarking for Arbitrary Resolution Images**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18297) (`arXiv:2311.18297`) by [Tu Bui](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/tu-bui)[^1], [Shruti Agarwal](https://research.adobe.com/person/shruti-agarwal/)[^2], and [John Collomosse](https://www.collomosse.com)[^1] [^2].

## Differences from the Python version

This crate implements a subset of the functionality of the Python version. Encoding and decoding of watermarks for all variants in binary mode is implemented. The same levels of error correction are available.

Text mode watermarks and watermark removal are not implemented.

Open an issue if there's something in the Python version that would be useful in this crate!

## Quick start

### Download models

In order to encode or decode watermarks, you'll need to fetch the model files. The models are distributed as ONNX files.

From the workspace root (e.g. from the `rust/` directory), run:

```
cargo xtask fetch-models
```

The models will be downloaded to the `models/` directory and can be moved wherever you need from there.

### Run the CLI

As a first step, you can run the `trustmark-cli` which is defined in this repository.

From the workspace root, run:

```sh
cargo run --release -p trustmark-cli -- -m ./models encode -i ../images/ghost.png -o ../images/encoded.png
cargo run --release -p trustmark-cli -- -m ./models decode -i ../images/encoded.png
```

If you have moved the models downloaded previously, pass the location where the models can be found in the `-m` parameter.

### Use the library

Add `trustmark` to your project's `cargo` manifest with:

```
cargo add trustmark
```

A basic usage example of `trustmark` is:

```rust
use trustmark::{Trustmark, Version, Variant};

let tm = Trustmark::new("./models", Variant::Q, Version::Bch5).unwrap();
let input = image::open("../images/ghost.png").unwrap();
let output = tm.encode("0010101".to_owned(), input, 0.95);
```

## Running the benchmarks

### Rust benchmarks

To run the Rust benchmarks, run the following from the workspace root:

```
cargo bench
```

### Python benchmarks

To run the Python benchmarks, run the following from the workspace root:

```
benches/load.sh && benches/encode.sh
```
